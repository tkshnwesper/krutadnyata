title:  "Anaemia Alleviation Scheme"

Ramchandra Godbole and his wife Suneeta served in medical field for more
than 10 years at Barsur (Dist. Bastar). Then they went to Maharashtra to serve
for Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram almost for 10 years. Again they returned to Barsur
for second time in the year 2010. They realized that situation in South Bastar
had changed and there was less need of daily medical Centre at Barsur, but
there was real need to arrange medical camps in the interior villages. So they
started arranging medical camps in the interior villages. Dr. Mukund Karmlkar
(Cardiologist) from Hyderabad joined this work in the year 2015. In the same
year a young tribal worker Mr. Chituram Vek (Age 22) joined the team. Since
then they arranged 84 medical camps successfully in Dantewnda, Sukama and
Bijapur districts of South Bastar. More than 8000 patients benefitted from these
camps.

- In post Corona Period, it has been decided to continue with arranging
general medical camps in different villages. However the emphasize will be
given for small children. (age group 6 to 12 years)

- From 1st January 2021 “Anemia Alleviation Program” for tribal children has
been launched.

- We are aiming to reduce anemic conditions in children of 6-12 years age
group below 8 gms % HB and those who are school dropouts.

- If HB % reaches 5% or less then blood is required to be given. Tribal are not
inclined to donate blood, so donors are required to be found out. There are
professional blood donors available in the market. Tribals pay huge price for
that blood; also there is risk of getting HIV/Hepatitis B infection. So we have
target before us to elevate HB upto 12 gms% and not to reach it below 8
gms% or 5% gms. So children could be saved from blood
transfusion/Admission or infected blood transfusion.
